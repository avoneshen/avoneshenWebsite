<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a developer and consultant currently working in marketing technology at Merkle. </p>
<p>My route into technology came through a background in liberal arts, and an MSc in Computer Science.</p>
<p>All that has given me a pretty unique take on things.</p>
<p>I have had exposure to a number of different platforms in marketing and ad tech - from direct marketing on CRM platforms to audience analysis and segmentation for digital channels.</p>
<p>Designing and building programs is more than just a job for me, and I love sharing and discussing things I've learned with others. Most of my spare time is spent working on some project or another - usually something gaming related!</p>
<p>So far, most of my work has been in C#, Java, JavaScript, and SQL (PostgreSQL / Microsoft SQL).</p>
